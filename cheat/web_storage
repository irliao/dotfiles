sessionStorage, localStorage and Cookies all are used to store data on the client side. Each one has its own storage and expiration limit.

localStorage: stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache / Locally Stored Data

sessionStorage: similar to localStorage but expires when the browser closed (not the tab).

Cookie: stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests.

Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read client-side.
