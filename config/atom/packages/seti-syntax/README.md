This is the latest version of the Seti Syntax theme. It's a dark syntax theme crafted especially for [Atom](http://atom.io), with subtle colors that are meant to be easy on the eyes. It is mean to be paired with [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) (though this is hardly a requirement).

##### **Please Note:** This is the Seti syntax theme for [Atom](http://atom.io) only

This is for the _syntax_ (i.e. code view) of the Atom editor. I also have [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) for theming the _interface_ in Atom.

If you're not in the market for an Atom theme, you can have a look at one of these great ports for other platforms:

+ [Emacs](https://github.com/caisah/seti-theme)
+ [iTerm](https://github.com/willmanduffy/seti-iterm)
+ [JetBrains](https://github.com/zchee/Seti_JetBrains)
+ [Sublime Text 3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Seti_UI)
+ [Vim](https://github.com/trusktr/seti.vim)

## What's New? 1.0 Update
Seti has reached 1.0, and it now integrates more tightly with Seti UI. There is also a new settings interface that allows you to select a base color theme.

## Settings
_To get here, Go to "Atom > Preferences" Select "Themes"  and click the settings icon next to "Seti" under Syntax Theme dropdown_

You can choose to have the syntax theme automatically adjust to match your selected theme in Seti UI (default), or select one of the built in themes.

_Please note this is some-what of a beta feature. The default blue theme has been pretty well tested, but the other colors are still being tweaked. Keep an eye out for updates, and please file a bug if you notice anything weird._
