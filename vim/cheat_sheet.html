<pre>
The arguments that you can use for the substitute commands:
[c]  Confirm each substitution.  Vim positions the cursor on the matching
  string.  You can type:
      'y'      to substitute this match
      'n'      to skip this match
      <Esc>   to skip this match
      'a'      to substitute this and all remaining matches {not in Vi}
      'q'      to quit substituting {not in Vi}
      CTRL-E  to scroll the screen up {not in Vi}
      CTRL-Y  to scroll the screen down {not in Vi}.
[e]     When the search pattern fails, do not issue an error message and, in
  particular, continue in maps as if no error occurred.  
[g]  Replace all occurrences in the line.  Without this argument,
  replacement occurs only for the first occurrence in each line.
[i]  Ignore case for the pattern.  
[I]  Don't ignore case for the pattern.  
[p]  Print the line containing the last substitute.

These commands move over words or WORDS.</p>
<p>A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a
sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.</p>
<p>A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
space.  An empty line is also considered to be a word and a WORD.</p>
